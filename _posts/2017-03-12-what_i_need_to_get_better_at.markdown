Lately I've been reviewing my progress and feel that I'm not gaining a good enough understanding to keep going forward full steam like I have previously.  There are a number of areas that I feel I should review before continuing and also a few things I will be doing differently going forward.

 ### Blogging more
 I was initally excited to blog as its something I've been meaning to do for a while now (in general) and this would give me a bit of a push to start.  I've been so focused on the learn modules and diving into the code that everytime I've started somethings come up and I've reverted back to the code.  Like taking notes (preview for below), I feel that blogging will help my understanding and even though it will take longer - I'm starting to think it will payoff in the long run.
 
 ### Going slower through the modules
 I've been blazing through the modules and have constantly gotten the urge to click on the "I'm done button" to progress but that urge has come at a cost of actually learning the material.  Its easy to say now but its easy to say you know a concept until you actually have to write the code for it.  I've spent some time staring at the screen not knowing where to start before going back to the the module and rereading to gain a better understanding.  Maybe a bit of a shift in thinking to "How will I actually use this" will help me avoid having to backtrack.  
 
 ### Taking notes
 I've slowly started taking notes but I need to do a better job of it.  I'm someone who has horrible handwriting and likes the idea of taking notes digitially so initially I've been using Onenote.  There was an interesting discussion on slack about how a few people are taking handwritten notes with different colors to help them in understanding.  It seems to inefficient to me but at the same time I'm sure it helps in understanding.  What's inefficient is going back through the material and relearning it (like I have been doing).  This will also spur me to get a better grasp of the concept before moving on.

I've decided to take on web development as my next learning challenge.  I realized recently that I will always be looking for a new challenge and to continue learning, and with the coding world being so vast, it seems like an endless supply of learning material.  From recently becoming a private pilot to traveling, I always try to understand the world around me and figure out how it works.  With software development, my main focus for this is to add new skills to add value to my career.  I'm not sure exactly where this will take me but I feel that coding will open up plenty of new doors for me.  

I am still very new at this but during my learning sessions and labs time seems to fly by which I hope is a good sign.  It seems at this point I am hooked and look forward to seeing my knowledge and skills progress over the next few months.

So I made it to the part in the learn curriculum where I need to create something truly from scratch.  Pretty much everything up until this point had some code already entered or at least some guidelines but now its time for me to create something of my own.  Initially it was hard to decide on what site to uses.  Something which might sound interesting at the same time might not have a good site to scrape. Something else that isn’t interesting might not hold your attention for the hours this project will take.  

I decided to scrape the Controller.com airplane marketplace site for used plane listings.  The site seems simple enough at first glance (at least there isn’t a lot of animations and moving pieces).  After I got my scrapper working however, I realized there might be an issue with the site.  The scraped data would be fine for a while but then would seem to revert to general HTML without the airplane data.  After getting some help on slack i determined that I would just save the HTML and scrape so there would be not chance of having it changed up.

After that hurdle, my other challenge was choosing the different features and data to display for the planes.  There are so many different selling points to planes (like cars) that it would end up being information overload for the user.  I decided to keep things simple and show a list of planes first (just the year and plane type) and allow the user to select which one they wanted to learn more about.  The next screen would show the simple "profile" of the plane for sale including a description, seller, phone number and location.  I thought about adding total engine time and other avionics details but they seemed to clutter up the command line screen too much.  

This project is far from complete and I feel like i can polish it up quite a bit more. It was great to spend hours on something I was creating from scratch.  Even thought its not a business, I sort of had the feeling of ownership over this program and want it to reflect positivley on me.

Some of the things I learned (in no order):

*  write out pysdo code initially so that you have something to go off of when planning
*  google your problems/questions like crazy
*  commit often
*  Do not overcomplicate things and take one aspect of the program at a time


That's all for now.  I'm off to finish off the Object Oriented Ruby curriculum!
